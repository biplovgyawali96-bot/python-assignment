# 1 Write a program that asks a fisher the length of a zander in centimeters.
# If the zander does not fulfill the size limit, the program instructs to release the fish back into the lake and
# notifies the user of how many centimeters below the size limit the caught fish was.
# A zander must be 42 centimeters or longer to meet the size limit.

# length = int(input("Enter the length of the zander in centimeter: "))
# if length < 42:
#     sizelimit = 42 - length
#     print("Release the fish back into the lake!")
#     print("The fish was", sizelimit, "cm below the size limit.")
# else:
#     print("Good! The fish meets the size limit.")

# 2 Write a program that asks the user to enter the cabin class of a cruise ship and
# then prints out a written description according to the list below. You must use an if/elif/else structure in your solution.
# LUX: upper-deck cabin with a balcony.
# A: above the car deck, equipped with a window.
# B: windowless cabin above the car deck.
# C: windowless cabin below the car deck.
# If the user enters an invalid cabin class, the program outputs an error message Invalid cabin class.

# cabin = input("Enter the cabin class LUX, A, B, C: ")
# if cabin == "LUX":
#     print("Upper-deck cabin with a balcony.")
# elif cabin == "A":
#     print("Above the car deck, equipped with a window.")
# elif cabin == "B":
#     print("Windowless cabin above the car deck.")
# elif cabin == "C":
#     print("Windowless cabin below the car deck.")
# else:
#     print("Invalid cabin class.")

# 3 Write a program that asks for the biological gender and hemoglobin value (g/l). The program the notifies the user if the hemoglobin value is low, normal or high.
# A normal hemoglobin value for adult females is between 117-155 g/l.
# A normal hemoglobin value for adult males is between 134-167 g/l.

# gender = input("Enter gender: ")
# h = int(input("Enter hemoglobin value (g/l): "))
# if gender == "female":
#     if h < 117:
#         print("Hemoglobin is low")
#     elif h > 155:
#         print("Hemoglobin is high")
#     else:
#         print("Hemoglobin is normal")
# elif gender == "male":
#     if h < 134:
#         print("Hemoglobin is low")
#     elif h > 167:
#         print("Hemoglobin is high")
#     else:
#         print("Hemoglobin is normal")

# 4 Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and notifies the user whether the input year is a leap year.
# A year is a leap year if it is divisible by four. However, years divisible by 100 are leap years only if they are also divisible by 400.


# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
# if year % 4 != 0:
#     print("not a leap year")
# elif year % 100 != 0:
#     print("leap year")
# elif year % 400 == 0:
#     print("leap year")
# else:
#     print("not a leap year")
